## **Matallic Materials Defects Images**

## **Introduction**

Images of AlSi10Mg and SDSS (super duplex stainless steel) 2507 were captured via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) manufactured by ZEISS, and images of ZK60Mg were captured via light optical microscopy (LOM) manufactured by LEICA. Images of each metallic sample are all from the same sample.

The 'AlSi10Mg' folder includes images related to silicon network and two types of surface defects (inclusion and porosity) of AlSi10Mg alloy; the 'SDSS2507' folder includes porosity defects of super duplex stainless steel sample, and different name numbers of subfolders represent different cut subblocks from the same individual sample; the 'ZK60Mg' folder includes two types of surface defects (crack and porosity) of ZK60Mg alloy.
